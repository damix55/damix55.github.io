I am a **Python specialist** with expertise in **web development** and **RPA**, backed by a master's degree in **Computer Science**. I have a strong passion for technology and music. I thrive where creativity and problem solving intersect.

My natural curiosity leads me to explore new interests, experiment with new technologies, and learn about the inner workings of things.
